            As the world's capacity to deal with the fast rising output of
            disposable plastic goods becomes
            overwhelmed, plastic pollution has emerged as one of the most urgent environmental challenges. In
            impoverished Asian and African countries, where rubbish collection services are either ineffective or
            nonexistent, plastic pollution is most noticeable. However, the industrialised world also has issues with
            adequately collecting used plastics, particularly in nations with poor recycling rates. The United Nations
            has been trying to create a global convention because plastic waste has become so pervasive.</span>

                <li>Refuse plastic whenever possible. Say no to straws, lids, plastic bags, and plastic takeaway
                    containers. Carry your own utensils or a wooden spork and avoid using plastic utensils.</li>
                <li>Use reusable bags, water bottles, and coffee mugs. Some merchants may even give you a discount as a
                    result!</li>
                <li>Avoid anything that is excessively wrapped in plastic.</li>
